# Center Stage

This is an open-source version of self-framing webcam. Center Stage is a personal experiment that was used to define, improve, and then abstract a face detection model and workflow. While Center Stage was not the primary focus of a face detection library for me, there did not exist any simple software that aimed to solve this problem.

Video conferences and meetings are tedious and keeping the framing just right can be a lot of work while you're trying to focus. So, Center Stage will make sure that you always are the center of attention and never get lost as you move around.

This is extremely resource intensive, so everything is handled on the GPU side of things.
